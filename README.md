## FAQ

1. Why are you building LineageOS 16.0 when there is an official support?

    - I'd rather flash MIUI than to use those builds with those trees.

2. What's different from official builds?

    - I'm adding few things here and there that which you can check in the changelogs and they are available my GitHub repos.

3. Does it support Over-the-Air updates?

    - Yes!

4. Will your builds pass the root check, CTS and wont have problems with banking apps?

    - Yes, the builds are signed with personal keys and are using release-keys for build tag!

5. Awesome, what can I do to switch from official to your builds?

    - Back up your data and clean flash the build. Then just sit and enjoy!

6. I have encountered a bug, whan can I do?

    - Create a bug report in the Issues section. Bug reports without logs will be closed and ignored!

7. Why did you close your threads at XDA and leave?

    - Because of their greedy behaviour at making money, slow load and reponse or not loading at all and the arrogant interaction between the staff and users.

8. I like your builds, how can I support you?
