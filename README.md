# Advanced-LineageOS-Releases

These are personal releases of LineageOS 16.0 for Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 and I am just posting them here. I have included few things which I need and they are mentioned below which differ from the original LineageOS 16.0 and i.e. it is called Advanced LineageOS 16.0.

If you have any question or suffering from an issue post it in the issues tab on GitHub. I would need logcat to check what's wrong otherwise I wouldn't know. 

The builds will be released as I have free time to mess around, but it is guaranteed that I will upload a build right after a new security patch is merged.
