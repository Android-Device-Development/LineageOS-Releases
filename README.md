# LineageOS Releases

FAQ:

1. Why are you building LineageOS 16.0 when there is an official support?

- The builds are so bad. I'd rather flash MIUI than to use those builds with those trees. I suggest you to stay away from those builds. Yuck!

2. What's different from official builds?

- I'm adding few things here and there that which you can check in the changelogs and they are available my GitHub repos.

3. Does it support Over-the-Air updates?

- Yes!

4. Will your builds pass the root check, CTS and wont have problems with banking apps?

- Yes, the builds are signed with personal keys and are using release-keys for build tag!

5. Awesome, what can I do to switch from official to your builds?

- Back up your data and clean flash the build. Then just sit and enjoy!

6. I have encountered a bug, whan can I do?

- Create a bug report in the Issues section. Bug reports without logs will be closed and ignored!

7. Why did you close your threads at XDA and leave?

- Because of their greedy behaviour at making money, slow load and reponse or not loading at all and stupid and arrogant interaction between the staff and users.
