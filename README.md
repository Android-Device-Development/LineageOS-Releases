# Advanced-LineageOS-Releases

These are personal releases of LineageOS 16.0 for Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 and I am just posting them here. 

There are two versions. 

**CLEAN** 

Nothing added at all, pure stock LineageOS 16.0 experience

**ADVANCED**

I have included few things which I need that differ from the original LineageOS 16.0, like optimizations on the framework part, screenshot and sound toggle etc. so that's why it is called Advanced LineageOS 16.0. 

The builds will be released as I have free time to mess around, but it is guaranteed that I will upload a build right after a new security patch is merged.

Since this is quite time consuming process and I'm doing it quite often, so if you enjoy it, I would be thankful and grateful if you donate a cup of coffee!
