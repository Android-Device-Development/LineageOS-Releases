# Advanced-LineageOS-Releases

These are personal releases of LineageOS 16.0 for Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 and I am just posting them here. I have included few things which I need and they are mentioned below which differ from the original LineageOS 16.0 and i.e. it is called Advanced LineageOS 16.0. 

The builds will be released as I have free time to mess around, but it is guaranteed that I will upload a build right after a new security patch is merged.
