# Advanced-LineageOS-Releases

These are personal releases of LineageOS 16.0 and I am just posting them here. If you have any question or suffering from an issue post it in the issues tab on GitHub. I would need logcat to check what's wrong otherwise I wouldn't know. The builds will be released as I have free time to mess around, but it is guaranteed that I will upload a build right after a new security patch is merged.
